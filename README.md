# GoogleAds_Filter_YouTube_Channels
All comments are in russian by now. Wrote this script year and a half ago, and I haven't tested it since when. As far as I remember, Google Ads Scripts team has deleted funtions that allow making negative lists based on YouTube Channels. I didn't check it so far and I don't want to :) So, script may not work in this case properly. Maybe, one day I'll fix it.

APIs:
- YouTube API,
- DriveApp API,
- Spreadsheet API

This script checks and filters youtube channels, that contain specific words in title, description and etc, using Google Spreadsheet. Nothing special, but it might help.
